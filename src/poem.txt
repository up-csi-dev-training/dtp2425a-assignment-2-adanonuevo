Roses are red,
Violets are blue,
I love how you
Turn to the view
The sky is so light,
The stars shining bright,
You light up my life,
With your soft, glowing eyes.
The moon whispers softly,
And the clouds drift away,
In your arms, down I lay and find
A reason to stay.
The salt air in your hair,
The life in your eyes,
Every moment lived 
With hues of the skies.
So here, as we stay,
With time quickly passing by,
You turn, and my heart
Soars to the sky.
